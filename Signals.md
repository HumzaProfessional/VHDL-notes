``` vhdl
signal <name>: <data type>; // notation
```

Signals can be grouped together in VHDL.  
- These groupings are called vectors. •
-  Specify bit value range •
-  Can use downto or to in range declaration •
-  Can access subvectors within vector •
-  Can access individual signals within vector •
-  Can merge vectors into larger vector
