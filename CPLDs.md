### CLPD Overview
- Geberally lower gate densities
- Genrally lower pin counts
- Generally lower costs
- Generally lower power consumption
- Favoirs cobinaiotnla logic
- Nonvolatile configuraiton storage (memort retains without power)

#### Combinaiotnal loigcsl in CPLDS
- All combinational logic can be represented as  sun-of-products
